# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python

## Data Scientist Microdegree Capstone Project

#### COVID-19, short for "coronavirus disease 2019", is a highly contagious respiratory illness and it has affected major parts of the world.

#### Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

#### Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 had significant effects on Nigeria in 2020, impacting public health, economy, and daily life. The country implemented measures like lockdowns and travel restrictions to curb the spread, but these also posed challenges for businesses and livelihoods. The healthcare system faced strain, and there were socio-economic implications, especially for vulnerable populations. The overall impact was multifaceted, requiring a coordinated response across various sectors.

#### The goal of this project is to employ data science & analytics skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.

#### To complete the goal of this project,I,

#### * Collected data from the NCDC (Nigerian Centre for Disease Control) website, the John Hopkins repository as well as external data from websites,
#### * Cleaned and preprocessed the data to check for missing values and outliers,
#### * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics and identify patterns and, Apply selected methods to the data and interpret the results with the use of graphs to communicate insights on the effects of COVID-19 on the nation, Nigeria.

#### My executive summary will be communicated through a Microsoft Powerpoint.
